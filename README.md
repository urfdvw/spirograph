# Javascript simulation of the Spirograph toy 

With this web app, you can simulate the spirograph toy. You can change the parameters and observe the effect. We also provide instructions for exploring the parameters, and puzzles to think about.

This project is inspired by [Nathan Friend Spirograph](https://nathanfriend.io/inspirograph/) but written from scratch. By giving more freedom in choosing parameters we focus on the math part, while Nathan Friend Spirograph focuses on the artistic part.
